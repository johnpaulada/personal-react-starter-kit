A template for me to start working on my frontend stuff.

## Stack

## Contributing Rules

- We use the the
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#specification)
  convention for commits. Here are
  [more intents](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional)
  for your commits.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Extract the components I use here to their own libraries, something like
      React Hooks or JS libs.
- [ ] Use Crocks or Sanctuary
